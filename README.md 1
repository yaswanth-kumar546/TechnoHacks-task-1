OVE VIEW OF THIS PROJECT:
This project is a simple calculator application created using Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/).
**FEATURES:
   * User Input: Prompts the user to input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /).
   * Error Handling: Validates user inputs to ensure they are correct (e.g., valid numbers and operations) and handles divisions by zero.
   * Continuous Use: After performing a calculation, the user is asked if they would like to perform another calculation.

Future Enhancements:
   * Save contacts to a file for persistence.
   * Implement user authentication for accessing contacts.
   * Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
